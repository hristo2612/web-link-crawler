# Crawl all of the links of a given web page

1. Clone this repository
2. `npm install` into the folder
3. In `index.js` change the `urls` with your target websites ( could be multiple entities )
4. `npm start`
5. Boooooom, you have all the links from all the web pages!


#### Todo list:

1. Make it a global installable npm package
2. Make it take arguments from the command line ( such as the target urls )
